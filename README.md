# ðŸ“± SMS Spam Detection System (TF-IDF + LightGBM)

A lightweight and efficient machine learning project to classify **SMS messages as SPAM or HAM** using traditional NLP techniques and a tuned LightGBM classifier. Designed for performance and clarity, this pipeline is ideal for beginners and intermediate ML practitioners.

## ðŸš€ Highlights

- ðŸ“Š Uses **TF-IDF** vectorization to convert SMS text into numeric features
- ðŸŒ³ Trains a **LightGBM model** using GridSearchCV for best performance
- ðŸ“ˆ Evaluates model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC AUC
- ðŸ’¾ Saves preprocessed vectors and model to disk
- ðŸ§¹ Clean and modular structure (Preprocessing â†’ Training â†’ Prediction-ready)
